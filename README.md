#### Hi, my name is Claire Violet. I'm a trans software engineer, archivist, and photographer. My pronouns are she/her or it/its, whichever you feel most comfortable using. I live in beautiful, sunny Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington. 
- For work, I write Typescript + React in a frontend role on a developer experience team. My focus is on improving our design system.
- I graduated from Clemson University's School of Computing.
- Also, I volunteer as an archivist at the [@connectionsmuseum](https://github.com/connectionsmuseum), a museum of electromechanical telephone switches from 1923—2005, located in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood.
- In my free time, I'm a film photographer. You can find more information about that on one of my websites.
