### Hello! I'm Claire Violet, a trans software engineer living in Charlotte, NC.
My current job doesn't use GitHub, so I don't have many commits here, but I'm looking for some new side projects to clean out some of the dust and branch out. I've mostly been a Java and web developer until now, but I'm looking to try some new languages and frameworks again. Here's some other things you might like to know:
- 🔖 My pronouns are she/her.
- 🐯 I graduated from the Clemson University School of Computing!
- 📫 If you'd like to see my resume, I'd love to show you! Please email me!
